## 1. Input Data
- **Source File:** `concert.csv`

---

## 2. AI-Generated Analysis & Transformation Plan
The AI analyzed the data and generated the following plan, which was then executed.

**Step 1: Remove Column** on column `actualgross`

> *Reason: The column 'actualgross' is an identifier column with unique values for each row and does not provide analytical value.*

**Step 2: Remove Column** on column `adjustedgross_in_2022_dollars`

> *Reason: The column 'adjustedgross_in_2022_dollars' is an identifier column with unique values for each row and does not provide analytical value.*

**Step 3: Remove Column** on column `tour_title`

> *Reason: The column 'tour_title' is an identifier column with unique values for each row and does not provide analytical value.*

**Step 4: Remove Column** on column `average_gross`

> *Reason: The column 'average_gross' is an identifier column with unique values for each row and does not provide analytical value.*

**Step 5: Remove Column** on column `ref`

> *Reason: The column 'ref' is an identifier column with unique values for each row and does not provide analytical value.*

**Step 6: Convert Type** on column `peak`

> *Reason: The 'peak' column contains numeric data stored as strings with brackets and annotations. Converting it to numeric after cleaning will allow for numerical analysis. Missing values will be represented as NaN.*

**Step 7: Convert Type** on column `all_time_peak`

> *Reason: The 'all_time_peak' column contains numeric data stored as strings with brackets and annotations. Converting it to numeric after cleaning will allow for numerical analysis. Missing values will be represented as NaN.*

**Step 8: Create Feature** on column `start_year`

> *Reason: Extract the starting year from the 'years' column to facilitate time-based analysis. The regex will extract the first 4 digit number from the string.*

**Step 9: Convert Type** on column `start_year`

> *Reason: Convert the 'start_year' column to integer type for numerical analysis.*
