## 1. Input Data
- **Source File:** `AmazonMobileDataUncleaned.csv`

---

## 2. AI-Generated Analysis & Transformation Plan
The AI analyzed the data and generated the following plan, which was then executed.

**Step 1: Remove Duplicates**

> *Reason: Removing duplicate rows ensures that each data point is unique and prevents skewed analysis results.*

**Step 2: Remove Column** on column `unnamed2`

> *Reason: The 'unnamed2' column has a very high number of missing values (99.99%) and the few existing values seem to be random characters, making it useless for analysis.*

**Step 3: Remove Column** on column `unnamed3`

> *Reason: The 'unnamed3' column contains almost entirely missing values (99.99%) and provides no useful information for analysis.*

**Step 4: Remove Column** on column `unnamed4`

> *Reason: The 'unnamed4' column is almost entirely missing values (99.99%) and the single value present seems to be random characters, making it irrelevant for analysis.*

**Step 5: Clean Text** on column `review_text`

> *Reason: Cleaning the 'review_text' column is crucial for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.  Lowercasing ensures case-insensitive analysis, while removing punctuation, digits, and non-ASCII characters reduces noise and improves the accuracy of NLP models.*

**Step 6: Clean Categorical** on column `decision`

> *Reason: Cleaning the 'decision' column ensures that only valid categories ('positive' and 'negative') are present, allowing for accurate grouping and analysis.  Invalid values will be removed.*

**Step 7: Fill Missing** on column `review_text`

> *Reason: Imputing missing 'review_text' values with the most frequent value minimizes information loss and allows for complete analysis of the text data.*

**Step 8: Fill Missing** on column `decision`

> *Reason: Filling missing 'decision' values with the most frequent category ('positive') is a simple and effective strategy to handle missing data in this categorical column.*
