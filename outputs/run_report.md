## 1. Input Data
- **Source File:** `datasets/TG-NPDCL_consumption_detail_agriculture_AUGUST-2025.csv`

---

## 2. AI-Generated Analysis & Transformation Plan
The AI analyzed the data and generated the following plan, which was then executed.

**Step 1: Remove Duplicates**

> *Reason: Removing duplicate rows ensures that the analysis is not skewed by repeated data.*

**Step 2: Convert Type** on column `totservices`

> *Reason: Converting 'totservices' to a numeric type allows for calculations and analysis.*

**Step 3: Convert Type** on column `billedservices`

> *Reason: Converting 'billedservices' to a numeric type allows for calculations and analysis.*

**Step 4: Convert Type** on column `units`

> *Reason: Converting 'units' to a numeric type allows for calculations and analysis.*

**Step 5: Fill Missing** on column `totservices`

> *Reason: Filling missing values in 'totservices' with the mean preserves data and allows for further analysis.*

**Step 6: Fill Missing** on column `billedservices`

> *Reason: Filling missing values in 'billedservices' with the mean preserves data and allows for further analysis.*

**Step 7: Fill Missing** on column `units`

> *Reason: Filling missing values in 'units' with the mean preserves data and allows for further analysis.*

**Step 8: Scale Numeric** on column `load`

> *Reason: Scaling the 'load' column to a range between 0 and 1 using min-max normalization will improve the performance of machine learning models.*

**Step 9: Remove Column** on column `catcode`

> *Reason: The 'catcode' column has only one unique value, making it useless for analysis.*

**Step 10: Remove Column** on column `catdesc`

> *Reason: The 'catdesc' column has only one unique value, making it useless for analysis.*
