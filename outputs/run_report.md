## 1. Input Data
- **Source File:** `AmazonMobileDataUncleaned.csv`

---

## 2. AI-Generated Analysis & Transformation Plan
The AI analyzed the data and generated the following plan, which was then executed.

**Step 1: Clean Text** on column `review_text`

> *Reason: Cleaning the review text by lowercasing, removing punctuation, digits, and non-ASCII characters is crucial for effective text analysis and NLP tasks.*

**Step 2: Clean Categorical** on column `decision`

> *Reason: Cleaning the 'decision' column ensures it only contains 'positive' or 'negative' values, which is essential for accurate grouping and analysis. Other values appear to be noise.*

**Step 3: Remove Column** on column `unnamed2`

> *Reason: The 'unnamed2' column has a very high percentage of missing values and appears to contain random strings, making it useless for analysis.*

**Step 4: Remove Column** on column `unnamed3`

> *Reason: The 'unnamed3' column has a very high percentage of missing values and appears to contain random strings, making it useless for analysis.*

**Step 5: Remove Column** on column `unnamed4`

> *Reason: The 'unnamed4' column has a very high percentage of missing values and appears to contain random strings, making it useless for analysis.*

**Step 6: Remove Duplicates**

> *Reason: Removing duplicate rows ensures that the analysis is not skewed by repeated data.*

**Step 7: Fill Missing** on column `review_text`

> *Reason: Filling missing values in 'review_text' ensures that all reviews are accounted for in the analysis. Filling with 'missing' will allow us to keep track of the rows that had missing values.*

**Step 8: Fill Missing** on column `decision`

> *Reason: Filling missing values in 'decision' with the mode ensures that the most frequent category is used, minimizing potential bias.*
