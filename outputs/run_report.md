## 1. Input Data
- **Source File:** `AmazonMobileDataUncleaned.csv`

---

## 2. AI-Generated Analysis & Transformation Plan
The AI analyzed the data and generated the following plan, which was then executed.

**Step 1: Remove Duplicates**

> *Reason: Removing duplicate rows is crucial to prevent biased or skewed results in analysis.*

**Step 2: Clean Text** on column `review_text`

> *Reason: Text cleaning is essential for NLP tasks.  Lowercasing ensures case-insensitive analysis, while removing punctuation, digits, and non-ASCII characters reduces noise and improves the accuracy of subsequent NLP processes like tokenization and stemming.*

**Step 3: Fill Missing** on column `review_text`

> *Reason: Imputing missing 'review_text' values with the most frequent value minimizes data loss and preserves the integrity of the dataset for analysis.*

**Step 4: Fill Missing** on column `decision`

> *Reason: Filling missing values in the 'decision' column with the most frequent category ('positive') helps maintain data completeness and prevents bias in downstream analysis.*
