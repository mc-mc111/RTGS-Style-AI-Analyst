## Dataset Overview
This report analyzes a dataset comprising 8,082 records of service data, structured geographically from the circle level down to the section level.  Each record includes categorical information (circle, division, subdivision, section, area, catcode, and catdesc) describing the service location and type, along with quantitative measures of total and billed services ('totservices' and 'billedservices'), the number of units ('units'), and a 'load' metric, the nature of which requires further investigation within the analysis.

## Key Findings & Visualizations

### Distribution of 'totservices'
> **Question:** *What is the spread and central tendency of total services offered?*

**Summary Data:**
| Statistic | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Count | 8,077.00 |
| Mean | 170.61 |
| Std | 206.69 |
| Min | 0.00 |
| 25% | 20.00 |
| 50% | 88.00 |
| 75% | 256.00 |
| Max | 1,669.00 |


**Visualization:**

**Recommendation:** To address the substantial variation in total services offered (mean 170.61, std 206.69), prioritize resource allocation adjustments based on a detailed analysis of high and low service areas.

### Correlation between 'billedservices' and 'totservices'
> **Question:** *Is there a relationship between billed services and total services offered?*

**Summary Data:**
| Statistic | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Pearson Correlation | 0.05 |


**Visualization:**

> **Question:** *Which division has the highest average total services offered?*

**Summary Data:**
| Division | Mean |
|:---|---:|
| METPALLY | 472.82 |
| ARMOOR | 448.78 |
| GHANPUR | 339.83 |
| KARIMNAGAR RURAL | 311.42 |

| NIZAMABAD | 240.39 |
| RURAL WARANGAL | 236.95 |
| THORRUR | 210.66 |


**Visualization:**
![Top 15 Mean of 'totservices' by 'division'](insight_3_group_by_summary.png)

**Recommendation:**  Focus resource allocation and capacity building efforts on the Metpally division, which exhibits the highest average total services offered (472.82), to ensure sustainable service delivery.

### Top 15 Sum of 'units' by 'circle'

**Visualization:**
![Top 15 Sum of 'units' by 'circle'](insight_4_group_by_summary.png)

**Recommendation:**  Concentrate expansion and support strategies on the Bhadradri Kothagudem circle, given its significantly higher number of units (136016) compared to other circles, to maintain service quality and prevent oversaturation.

### Distribution of 'load'
> **Question:** *What is the distribution of load across different areas?*

**Summary Data:**
| Statistic | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Count | 8,075.00 |
| Mean | 0.10 |
| Std | 0.13 |
| Min | 0.00 |
| 25% | 0.01 |
| 50% | 0.05 |
| 75% | 0.15 |
| Max | 1.00 |


**Visualization:**
![Distribution of 'load'](insight_5_distribution.png)

**Recommendation:**  Address the uneven distribution of load (mean 0.1, std 0.13, max 1.0) by implementing targeted strategies to redistribute workloads, optimize staffing levels, and improve service efficiency in high-load areas.
