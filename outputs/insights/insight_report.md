## Dataset Overview
This report analyzes a dataset of 8,082 records detailing service performance across various geographical and categorical levels.  The data includes hierarchical location information (circle, division, subdivision, section, area), a categorical code and description (`catcode` and `catdesc`), total and billed services (`totservices` and `billedservices`),  the number of units served (`units`), and a load factor (`load`).  This analysis will explore the relationships between these variables to understand service provision across the different geographical regions and categories.

## Key Findings & Visualizations

### Distribution of 'totservices'
> **Question:** *What is the spread and central tendency of total services offered?*

**Summary Data:**
| Statistic | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Count | 8,077.00 |
| Mean | 170.61 |
| Std | 206.69 |
| Min | 0.00 |
| 25% | 20.00 |
| 50% | 88.00 |
| 75% | 256.00 |
| Max | 1,669.00 |


**Visualization:**

**Recommendation:** To address the significant variation in total services offered (standard deviation of 206.69), further investigation is needed to understand and optimize resource allocation across all service areas.

### Correlation between 'billedservices' and 'totservices'
> **Question:** *Is there a relationship between billed services and total services offered?*

**Summary Data:**
| Statistic | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Pearson Correlation | 0.05 |


**Visualization:**

**Recommendation:** Given the low Pearson correlation (0.05) between billed and total services, a review of billing practices and service delivery processes is recommended to ensure accurate billing and efficient service provision.

### Top 15 Mean of 'totservices' by 'division'
> **Question:** *Which division has the highest average total services offered?*

**Summary Data:**
| Division | Mean |
|:---|---:|
| METPALLY | 472.82 |
| ARMOOR | 448.78 |
| GHANPUR | 339.83 |
| KARIMNAGAR RURAL | 311.42 |
| JAGITYAL | 309.34 |
| DICHPALLY | 308.72 |
| BODHAN | 304.78 |
| JANGAON | 293.80 |
| KAMAREDDY | 278.78 |
| PEDDAPALLY | 272.11 |
| HANAMKONDA/RURAL | 260.72 |
| HUZURABAD | 257.51 |
| NIZAMABAD | 240.39 |
| RURAL WARANGAL | 236.95 |
| THORRUR | 210.66 |


**Visualization:**
![Top 15 Mean of 'totservices' by 'division'](insight_3_group_by_summary.png)

**Recommendation:**  Focus resource allocation and capacity improvements on the Metpally division, which exhibits the highest average total services offered (472.82), to prevent service overload and ensure service quality.

### Top 15 Sum of 'units' by 'circle'
> **Question:** *Which circle has the highest total number of units?*

**Summary Data:**
| Circle | Sum |
|:---|---:|
| BHADRADRI KOTHAGUDEM | 136,016.00 |
| KARIMNAGAR | 31,506.00 |
| NIZAMABAD | 22,553.00 |
| JAGITYAL | 11,640.00 |
| ADILABAD | 10,686.00 |

| PEDDAPALLY | 1,184.00 |
| KAMAREDDY | 983.00 |
| ASIFABAD | 822.00 |
| BHUPALAPALLY | 768.00 |
| MAHABUBABAD | 528.00 |
| NIRMAL | 129.00 |


**Visualization:**
![Top 15 Sum of 'units' by 'circle'](insight_4_group_by_summary.png)

**Recommendation:**  Prioritize resource allocation and infrastructure development in the Bhadradri Kothagudem circle, given its significantly larger number of units (136016) compared to other circles.

### Distribution of 'load'
> **Question:** *What is the distribution of load across different areas?*

**Summary Data:**
| Statistic | Value |
|:---|---:|
| Count | 8,075.00 |
| Mean | 0.10 |
| Std | 0.13 |
| Min | 0.00 |
| 25% | 0.01 |
| 50% | 0.05 |
| 75% | 0.15 |
| Max | 1.00 |


**Visualization:**
![Distribution of 'load'](insight_5_distribution.png)

**Recommendation:**  The uneven distribution of load (mean 0.1, std 0.13, max 1.0) suggests a need for a more equitable distribution of resources across areas;  a detailed analysis of high-load areas is recommended to identify and address potential bottlenecks.
